## Requirements

These scripts were written for use in a Unix/Linux/MacOSX environment
running bash-4.4.0, gawk-4.1.4, bowtie2-2.2.7 and samtools 1.2 (using htslib 1.2.1).




## Installation

These scripts can be run from whereever they are. 
They don't need to be installed.
However, should you wish to install them in ~/.local/bin/ or elsewhere ...

Link or copy Makefile.example and edit as appropriate.

```
ln -s Makefile.example Makefile
```

Then install. Installation will attempt to remove previous installs before installing.

```
make install
```
